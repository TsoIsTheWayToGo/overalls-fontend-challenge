# Questionnaire App 
(Overalls frontend challenge)

This is a Vite-powered Vue 3 application that asks users a series of questions across multiple pages. The app uses the Composition API and Pinia for state management. Itâ€™s designed to collect user information through various types of inputs, store the data, and then review the user's responses.

## Features

- **Dynamic Categories**: Questions are organized into categories, with each category representing a "page" of questions.
- **Progress Tracking**: Users can see their progress as they navigate through the questions.
- **Review Page**: After completing all questions, users are shown a review page to see their responses and given an option to retake the questionnaire.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Transitions between different pages of questions for a better user experience.
